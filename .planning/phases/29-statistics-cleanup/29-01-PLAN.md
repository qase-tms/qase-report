<objective>
Remove duplicate statistics components from Dashboard that duplicate StatusBarPill's functionality.

Purpose: Consolidate pass rate and status count displays into StatusBarPill (always visible in AppBar), eliminating redundant Dashboard cards that show the same information.

Output: Cleaner Dashboard with unique analytics widgets only; orphaned component files deleted.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove duplicate statistics from Dashboard</name>
  <files>src/components/Dashboard/index.tsx</files>
  <action>
Remove the redundant statistics components that duplicate StatusBarPill's functionality:

1. Remove imports for StatsCard and ProgressRingCard (lines 7 and 15)

2. Remove the four StatsCard usages (lines 57-85):
   - passed StatsCard
   - failed StatsCard
   - skipped StatsCard
   - broken StatsCard

3. Remove the ProgressRingCard usage (lines 87-93):
   - "Pass Rate" progress ring

4. Remove the associated comment "Statistics cards - 1x1 compact counters" and "Progress ring for pass rate visualization"

5. Keep all unique widgets:
   - SparklineCards (Pass Rate Trend, Duration Trend) - provide trend context
   - RunInfoCard, HostInfoCard - execution metadata
   - SuiteHealthCard - per-suite breakdown
   - AttentionRequiredCard, QuickInsightsCard - actionable lists
   - AlertsPanel, TrendsChart, TestHealthWidget, HistoryTimeline - analytics

Why: StatusBarPill in AppBar already shows pass rate ring (40px) and passed/failed/skipped/flaky counts. These Dashboard cards are redundant.
  </action>
  <verify>
`npm run build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors about unused imports.
`grep -r "StatsCard\|ProgressRingCard" src/components/Dashboard/index.tsx` returns no matches.
  </verify>
  <done>Dashboard/index.tsx no longer imports or renders StatsCard or ProgressRingCard. Build passes.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Delete orphaned component files</name>
  <files>
src/components/Dashboard/StatsCard.tsx
src/components/Dashboard/ProgressRingCard.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Delete the now-orphaned component files:

1. Delete `src/components/Dashboard/StatsCard.tsx`
   - Was only used in Dashboard/index.tsx (now removed)
   - 50 lines, displays single status count with percentage

2. Delete `src/components/Dashboard/ProgressRingCard.tsx`
   - Was only used in Dashboard/index.tsx (now removed)
   - 77 lines, displays circular progress ring with percentage

Pre-deletion verification: Confirm no other imports exist.
```bash
grep -r "from.*StatsCard" src/
grep -r "from.*ProgressRingCard" src/
```
Both should return empty after Task 1 completion.
  </action>
  <verify>
`ls src/components/Dashboard/StatsCard.tsx` returns "No such file or directory".
`ls src/components/Dashboard/ProgressRingCard.tsx` returns "No such file or directory".
`npm run build` succeeds (no missing module errors).
  </verify>
  <done>StatsCard.tsx and ProgressRingCard.tsx deleted. No orphaned components remain. Build passes.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Build verification: `npm run build` completes without errors
2. Orphan scan: `grep -r "StatsCard\|ProgressRingCard" src/` returns no matches
3. Visual check: Dashboard loads without the 4 stats cards and pass rate ring
4. StatusBarPill intact: AppBar still shows pass rate and quick stats
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Dashboard no longer shows duplicate StatsCard components (passed/failed/skipped/broken)
- Dashboard no longer shows duplicate ProgressRingCard (pass rate ring)
- StatsCard.tsx and ProgressRingCard.tsx files deleted from codebase
- Build passes with no TypeScript errors
- StatusBarPill continues to display pass rate and statistics in AppBar
- Dashboard retains all unique analytics widgets (SuiteHealth, TrendsChart, etc.)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/29-statistics-cleanup/29-01-SUMMARY.md`
