### UX Enhancements

- **KBD-02**: User can search with / shortcut
- **SCALE-01**: System handles 2000+ tests (enterprise scale)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Keyboard shortcuts | Deferred to v1.3 per user request |
| Enterprise scale (2000+ tests) | v1.2 targets 100-500 tests |
| Mobile-first design | Desktop-first, tablet supported, mobile later |
| Custom theme creation | Light/dark/system sufficient for v1.2 |
| Drag-and-drop dashboard | Fixed bento layout for v1.2 |
