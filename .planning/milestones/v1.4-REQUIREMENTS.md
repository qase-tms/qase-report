## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Hamburger-only menu (no text labels) | NN/G research shows 50% reduced discoverability |
| Split-view test details | Modal is simpler, achieves same goal |
| Mobile-first responsive | Desktop primary, mobile deferred to v1.5 |
| Animated transitions | Nice-to-have, not essential for v1.4 |
